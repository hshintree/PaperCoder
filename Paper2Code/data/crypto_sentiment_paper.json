                "text": "Today, a single social media post from a public figure can trigger billion-dollar fluctuations in global markets within minutes. As markets evolve, they are increasingly shaped by the collective psychology and behavior of investors. Investor sentiment, often reflected in social media posts on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), serves as a proxy for market expectations [1] . FSA quantifies these sentiments, typically classified as Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral, to forecast market movements. However, significant challenges remain in translating these classifications into actionable trading insights. First, sentiment classifications often lack precision and explainability. For instance, a Bullish label might indicate anything from a modest 2% price increase over five days to a substantial 10% rise over a month, making it difficult to establish clear trading strategies based on such vague signals [2] . Second, traditional FSA relies on human-annotated sentiment labels, which embed subjective interpretations of a text's market impact. These preconceived notions often diverge from historical market reactions, introducing a gap between sentiment perception and measurable outcomes. Finally, financial tweets differ significantly from traditional textual data due to their brevity, domain-specific jargon, and references to real-time events. Ignoring this context diminishes the relevance of sentiment analysis for predicting market trends [3] . To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to FSA that focuses on measurable market reactions rather than inferred intentions. Instead of relying on subjective, human-annotated sentiment labels, market-derived annotation is adopted, which directly ties labels to subsequent market movements. This approach leverages financial markets' well-defined metrics to replace manual annotations with precise, automated labels [2, 4] . By ground-ing sentiment in historical market responses, a closer alignment between sentiment analysis and actionable trading strategies is ensured. Additionally, contextual market data is incorporated into the analysis using a prompt engineering technique which enables language models to integrate key market indicators, such as price trends and market volatility directly into textual analysis [5] . By embedding this context into tweets, our method transforms FSA into a unified framework that synthesizes sentiment analysis and market prediction into one. Unlike traditional multi-model approaches, our framework eliminates the need for separate price prediction models and fusion layers, offering a language model approach to the problem of FSA.",

Labels are determined by the first barrier touched during this period, with dynamic adjustments based on market volatility [4] . For instance, the horizontal barriers (upper and lower) are scaled by a volatility estimate, ensuring that they are sensitive to the asset's price fluctuations. The vertical barrier ensures that observations remain time-bounded, preventing positions from being unrealistically held indefinitely. TBL addresses several key challenges in financial labeling. It provides an intuitive and explainable labeling mechanism that aligns with real-world trading practices [7] . By dynamically adjusting barriers based on market volatility, it remains robust across different market regimes. Its path dependence ensures that labels reflect the actual price trajectory rather than arbitrary points within a fixed timeframe, reducing lookahead bias. For example, in a volatile Bitcoin market, TBL adjusts the horizontal barriers to accommodate rapid price swings, ensuring that labels remain consistent with actionable trading opportunities. This adaptability makes TBL highly suitable for live trading and machine-learning applications [8] . Moreover, by combining profit-taking, stop-loss, and temporal constraints, TBL provides a comprehensive framework that captures market dynamics effectively while mitigating overfitting risks.",

                "text": "Sentiment analysis in financial markets emerged from the growing recognition that market psychology plays a crucial role in market movements [9] . As Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques advanced, they enabled the extraction of sentiments and emotions from large volumes of unstructured text, providing a means to quantify market psychology [10, 11] . Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, became valuable sources of real-time insights into investor sentiment, which could be used to predict financial market behavior. Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, had already been established as a method within NLP for extracting sentiments, making them well-suited for quantifying investor psychology and applying these signals to financial markets. The power of sentiment analysis in forecasting market trends, volatility, volume, and risk contributed to the birth of FSA [3, 2] . The primary goal of FSA has been to utilize NLP methods to capture investor sentiment and psychology, providing valuable insights for predicting market movements [2] . Over time, the field has evolved, and various methods have been developed to refine sentiment classification, improve prediction accuracy, and integrate more nuanced factors such as market context. In the subsequent sections, we will explore the current state of the art in FSA, examine existing gaps, and highlight how this study aims to address these challenges.",

It also draws on various data sources such as news headlines [18] , social media posts [19] , and financial documents [3] , with applications in volatility prediction, price prediction, and trend forecasting [2] . The core goal of FSA is to quantify investor sentiment from textual data to inform decision-making in financial markets. In this study, we focus on predicting Bitcoin's short-term market movements by quantifying sentiment from Bitcoin-related tweets. This task has been addressed by various studies, but we consider PreBit [20] to be the state-of-the-art in this area. Unlike many other studies, PreBit advances the field by passing the actual tweet representations, rather than their sentiment class labels, to the trend prediction model. This allows the model to learn patterns between the words in the tweets and the market movements they ought to predict. By retaining the tweet's representation, the model can identify nuanced relationships between specific words and their effect on market behavior, bridging the gap between textual sentiment and market outcomes.",

This limitation is not necessarily due to the inferiority of textual data compared to price-based features. Even when domain-specific, pre-trained word embeddings are used, the issue lies in how we still assign sentimental value to words based on subjective perceptions, rather than allowing the market's reaction to define these relationships. This leads to our core hypothesis: market-driven labels, learned from actual market movements, can better inform sentiment analysis models. By letting the market itself teach the model the significance of words, we aim to bridge the gap between textual content and market reactions, moving away from subjective interpretations. Our hypothesis also points to a second major challenge: contextualization. The context in which a tweet is shared-such as market conditions, sentiment trends, or external factors-can be more influential than the content itself. Previous research supports this idea, showing that expanded feature spaces, including factors like author credibility [1, 21, 22] , post volume [23] , and extracted topics of discussion [24] , significantly improve the performance of FSA models. In the next section, we discuss the latest developments in NLP and FSA that have inspired our research and highlight how our approach builds on these advances.",

These models have set a strong foundation for improving FSA tasks. FinBERT, for instance, adapts to the finance domain by effectively incorporating contextual information from financial texts, outperforming traditional machine learning algorithms in sentiment classification. Similarly, FinEAS, building upon Sentence-BERT, generates high-quality sentence embeddings that substantially enhance FSA task performance. CryptoBERT, which serves as the foundation for our study, is fine-tuned on cryptocurrency-related social media data, leveraging the BERTweet architecture and domain-specific training to accurately analyze crypto-related tweets. On the other hand, FinGPT [16] represents a breakthrough as a general-purpose financial advisor, demonstrating how LLMs can synthesize market data and provide accessible insights for developing financial models. In our work, we build upon CryptoBERT by incorporating market and temporal context into tweets, enabling the model to better detect patterns and improve prediction accuracy, ultimately offering more actionable insights for cryptocurrency investors. Our study is further inspired by research that examined the temporal window of tweet propagation during events like the COVID-19 and H1N1 pandemics, which suggested that the most impactful tweet propagation occurs within a window of 8 to 15 days [6, 25] . This finding informed our decision to focus on short-term trend prediction in the market, aligning with the intuition that market psychology (driven by fear and greed) manifests strongly in short-term fluctuations.",

These sentiment classifications are then used to predict next-day market movements, typically using fixed thresholds for bullish and bearish labels based on the next day's ROC [30, 2] . However, our approach takes a fundamentally different path by directly using market-derived labels to classify tweets, bypassing the subjectivity of human annotations. While the influence of social media sentiment on financial markets often extends up to 15 days, many studies oversimplify this relationship by relying on single-day thresholds [6] . Such methods fail to capture the prolonged effects of sentiment and ignore real-world trading practices, where trends span multiple days. Effective labeling must account for these dynamics and incorporate mechanisms like take-profit, stop-loss, and vertical barriers to manage risk and adapt to market volatility [7] . To address these challenges, we propose a trend-based labeling method inspired by TBL. This approach integrates historical volatility and market-defined barriers, creating explainable and actionable labels that establish a direct connection between textual inputs and market trends. The method dynamically adjusts upper and lower barriers based on market volatility, as detailed below:",

Once tweets are classified, the next task is to aggregate these results over a given timeframe to generate a definitive trading signal. These signals can then be used to take trading positions directly or as input to more complex models in combination with price-based or other signals. However, in this study, we focus on using our model as a single, end-to-end short-term trend classifier, excluding fusion with price-based predictions since our approach already integrates market-related information into the prompts. For comparative purposes, we also evaluate a price-based LSTM model similar to the one proposed by PreBit [20] , and a pre-trained time-series masking autoencoder model inspired by [33, 34] a simple fusion model that combines sentiment and price signals into one. This allows us to compare their performance with the signal generation methods derived from tweet classifications. We propose two methods for signal generation based on tweet aggregation, the majority and mean methods. These methods help generate both the direction and size of each trading position, which are later used in our backtesting experiments. The majority vote method aggregates daily tweet predictions by determining the majority sentiment class for a given day. Let N denote the total number of tweets in a day, and let N bullish , N bearish , and N neutral represent the number of tweets classified as Bullish, Bearish, and neutral, respectively. The majority signal, denoted as S majority , is defined by Eq. ( 6):",

The first strategy, the TBL strategy, uses volatility-based dynamic barriers (as defined by Eq. ( 3), and Eq. ( 4)) to define take-profit and stop-loss levels, allowing for adaptive trading decisions based on market conditions. Optimized parameters for barrier thresholds and time limits are tuned for each evaluation period to maximize strategy performance. The second set of strategies referred to as In-Out strategies, employ aggregated daily signals to determine entry and exit points. The In-Out-Long strategy opens long positions when a Bullish signal is detected and closes them upon receiving a Bearish signal, while the In-Out-Short strategy operates inversely, opening short positions with Bearish signals and closing them with Bullish ones. These strategies incorporate normalized confidence scores derived from the sentiment classification process to scale position sizes, ensuring that trades reflect the model's certainty in its predictions. Additionally, we use a baseline buy-and-hold strategy for comparison, which provides a simple benchmark to contextualize the performance of the proposed methods. The backtesting process is conducted using the vectorbt library 5 , offering a comprehensive and efficient framework for evaluating trading strategies across varying market conditions. Recognizing the data dependency of backtesting results, we evaluate the proposed strategies over multiple market regimes, spanning different periods of bullish, bearish, and neutral trends. This ensures a robust assessment of strategy performance and generalizability. Key performance metrics include profitability measures, such as cumulative return and daily return; risk measures, including maximum drawdown and volatility; and profit-to-risk ratios like the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. By analyzing these metrics, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy relative to the buy-and-hold baseline, providing insights into the applicability of sentiment-driven trading signals in diverse market environments. 5 github.com/polakowo/vectorbt 5 Results",

The primary objective is to evaluate whether fine-tuning sentiment models on market-derived labels and incorporating contextual information can enhance the performance of traditional sentiment models in forecasting short-term market movements. The models are fine-tuned on a dataset from 2020 (E a ), consisting of approximately 60,000 tweets evenly distributed across the three trend classes, and evaluated on both E a and an event-sampled dataset (E b ). The E b dataset includes around 40,000 tweets from 2015 to 2023 (excluding 2020) and focuses on tweets related to significant Bitcoin events. This dataset represents high-volatility, news-rich scenarios, providing an opportunity to test the robustness of the models under diverse market conditions. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, grouped 5-fold cross-validation is employed, preventing information leakage by grouping tweets based on their temporal proximity. The training is conducted over 2 epochs per fold, as experiments demonstrate that performance plateaus beyond this point, indicating that the models effectively converge within this limit. Baseline models, FinBERT [14] and CryptoBERT [15] , respectively called Base-1, and Base-2 in Table 1 , exhibit poor performance in predicting short-term market trends, achieving F1-scores of 17.2% and 27.7% on E a , respectively. These results highlight the limitations of sentiment-based models in capturing short-term market movements. This underperformance can be attributed to the fact that these models are trained to interpret sentiment labels based on human annotations, which reflect subjective sentiment rather than actual market behavior. Consequently, the models cannot connect textual features with market-derived outcomes, as they are not explicitly trained on labels derived from market movements. In contrast, the CUA model, fine- tuned with the proposed market-derived labels, demonstrates significant improvement, achieving an F1-score of 43.0% on E a highlighting the importance of using market-derived labeling to bridge the gap between textual features and market dynamics.",

While the model performs well on E a , its performance on E b is noticeably lower, suggesting that the inclusion of temporal context may increase the risk of overfitting to the training data. This reduced performance on the unseen event-sampled data indicates that the model may not generalize as effectively as the CA model, which performs better on E b with an F1-score of 80.3% (\u00b10.2%). The CA model also performs well on E a with an F1-score of 89.5% (\u00b113.2%) and on E b with a score of 80.3% (\u00b10.2%), but similarly exhibits considerable variability. This variability in performance across folds is more pronounced in the CA and TCA models compared to the base models, where performance remains more stable. These variations highlight the sensitivity of the models to specific data splits. To mitigate these fluctuations, we adopt a majority voting strategy for the subsequent experiments, where predictions are aggregated across all five folds. This ensemble learning approach reduces the influence of fold-specific anomalies, enhances stability, and provides a more reliable evaluation of model performance. Additionally, paired t-tests comparing the CA and CUA models against Base-1 (CryptoBERT) model across the five folds confirm statistically significant differences in performance (p < 0.001 for both comparisons), further vali-dating the robustness and superior performance of the proposed models.",

Excluding the previous label causes the model's accuracy to drop significantly to 43.6%, highlighting its pivotal role in aligning tweet content with past market trends. On the other hand, removing RSI and ROC results in accuracies of 79.0% and 78.8%, respectively, indicating that these features, while less critical than the previous label, still contribute substantially to model performance. To confirm that the model is not overly reliant on prompts and effectively interprets tweet content, we conducted extensive SHAP value analysis [35] on a diverse range of tweets. Our tests revealed a wide variety of contributions from different parts of the tweets, demonstrating the model's ability to adapt to varying linguistic patterns and contexts. Figure 3 illustrates one such sample from our analysis, showcasing how specific words influence the model's prediction. In this example, despite a Bullish previous label, the model predicts a Bearish outcome primarily due to the strong contribution of the word \"downward\" in the tweet. The SHAP values indicate that \"downward\" exerts a dominant influence on the prediction, strongly shifting the model's decision toward bearishness. This analysis confirms that the model effectively processes tweet content, ensuring predictions are based on meaningful contextual analysis rather than superficial reliance on the prompt information. The results validate the robustness of the model in integrating contextual information and analyzing tweet content for accurate market predictions.",

While effective in some cases, such architectures fail to capture nuanced interactions between textual and market features, leading to potential information loss and requiring more data and a more complex architecture. In contrast, our CA language model integrates market features (e.g., previous trend, ROC, RSI) directly into tweet prompts as textual descriptions, allowing for an end-to-end prediction process that inherently models these interactions.

For each tweet, our proposed model generates predictions using an ensemble majority voting method across a 5-fold cross-validation setup, ensuring data diversity among the models. These individual predictions are then aggregated daily using either the majority or mean aggregation methods. The fusion model takes the daily predictions based on the majority aggregation method as input, alongside traditional sentiment and price-based predictions, to ensure it has access to all available features. The final output from the model is a predicted class (bullish, bearish, or neutral) for each day. For sentiment features, the fusion model receives the ratio of bullish to bearish tweets, represented as a continuous value between 0 and 1, which has proven to be more effective than using the final prediction class. Similarly, price-based models provide a final predicted class utilizing features such as OHLCV, Ethereum price, gold price, RSI, ROC, MACD, and moving averages (SMA7, SMA21, EMA12, EMA26).

A significant challenge in evaluating trading strategies is their dependence on the prevailing market regime, which can influence performance. To ensure a comprehensive assessment, we test our strategies across three distinct market regimes, as shown in Figure 5 . These regimes include a Bullish regime from 2017 to 2018, characterized by rapid market growth of approximately 1200%, a Bearish regime from 2018 to 2019, marked by a sharp decline of 250%, and a Neutral regime from mid-2019 to mid-2020, which demonstrated moderate stability with around a 40% increase. The proposed signal generation methods are applied across three trading strategies. To contextualize these methods, we compare their performance against the buy-and-hold and sell-and-hold benchmarks, which offer a baseline representing passive strategies that follow market trends. By testing these strategies across diverse market conditions, we aim to understand the adaptability and robustness of the proposed methods in generating actionable trading signals. The results presented in Table 3 highlight several notable patterns. During the Bullish period, the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy delivers an impressive Sharpe ratio of 3.14 and a daily return of 3.38%, reflecting Bitcoin's remarkable upward momentum. Despite the benchmark's strong performance, four out of six proposed strategies exceeded this Sharpe ratio, with all strategies outperforming the benchmarks across the other two market regimes, demonstrating robust adaptability.

                "text": "In this study, we demonstrate that a direct, market-based approach to classifying tweets outperforms traditional sentimentbased models in predicting Bitcoin's short-term market movement. Traditional sentiment analysis often fails to bridge the gap between textual sentiment and actual market behavior, as evidenced by the poor performance of the CryptoBERT [15] and FinBERT [14] models, which achieved F1-scores of only 25.2% and 16.7%, respectively, on a dataset of historical Bitcoin events. In contrast, by using market-derived labeling-defining clear profit/loss and temporal boundaries-we establish a direct link between text and market outcomes. Fine-tuning language models with these market-derived labels improved the F1-score by 15.3%, and further integrating market context through prompttuning boosted performance by a staggering 47%, reaching an F1-score of 80.3%. We also show that our model, which aggregates the predictions of the context-aware language model into actionable signals, can act as an effective standalone short-term market signal generator. Compared to the traditional fusion model approach, our method consistently outperforms benchmarks, achieving Sharpe ratios of up to 5.07 in trending markets and 3.73 in neutral conditions. These results highlight the untapped potential of language-based models for financial fore-casting. These findings demonstrate the transformative potential of language models in financial forecasting. These models can produce actionable insights, generate effective trading strategies, and manage risk in highly volatile markets by moving beyond sentiment classification to integrate context and market signals.",

                "text": "We recommend an in-depth exploration of language-based models for financial decision-making, moving beyond their integration as mere features within traditional numerical forecasting models. Future research could focus on three key areas: First, leveraging LLMs to power chatbots for investment advisory services, assisting financially inexperienced users in navigating investment strategies, best practices, and financial knowledge. Second, advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enable an interactive, query-based interface for financial reports, offering faster, more intuitive access to critical asset information and potentially democratizing detailed financial analysis. Third, improvements in prompt tuning, along with novel feature engineering-such as incorporating tweet author reliability, social media engagement, and technical indicators-could substantially elevate the performance of these models. Additionally, personalizing financial advice by tailoring recommendations to individual profiles, risk tolerance, and goals could transform how financial planning is approached. While the potential of language models in finance is significant, their value must be substantiated through robust evaluation frameworks. These frameworks must simulate real-world conditions, incorporating transaction costs, varying market regimes, and other practical considerations, to fully assess the models' real-world applicability and effectiveness in financial decision-making.",

We start by benchmarking traditional sentiment models, specifically FinBERT and CryptoBERT, against our dataset labeled with market-derived trends. This initial step sets the baseline for understanding if sentiment alone can predict market shifts. Following this, we fine-tune the CryptoBERT model on these market-derived labels, creating what we call the Context-UnAware (CUA) model. This model is designed to detect patterns in tweet content that correlate with market trends, preserving the model's existing knowledge of cryptocurrency jargon and tweet structures. The fine-tuning process involves freezing the first 11 layers of CryptoBERT to maintain this domain-specific knowledge while only adjusting the classification head. The training was conducted over 2 epochs with a 5-fold cross-validation strategy to avoid overfitting, using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 10 -5 and a batch size of 12. A learning rate scheduler with a linear warm-up phase (10% of steps) was employed to facilitate gradual learning. Building on the insights from previous research on the synergy between market context and textual content[3], we then introduce market context into our model's input through prompt engineering.",
