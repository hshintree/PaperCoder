Additionally, we must incorporate prompt tuning features to effectively integrate market context into the models. Here's a structured logic analysis for implementing `model.py`:\n\n### Objective\nThe primary objective of `model.py` is to establish the configuration and functionality of language models (CryptoBERT and FinBERT) tailored to predict financial market movements based on tweets. This involves utilizing market-derived labels and incorporating relevant market context through prompt engineering.\n\n### Class Definitions\n1. **Model Class for CryptoBERT and FinBERT**: \n   - **Initialization**: Accepts a `params` dictionary containing model-specific settings such as model type, prompt tuning configurations, and training hyperparameters as defined in `config.yaml`.\n   - **Model Loading**: Load the respective pre-trained BERT model (`CryptoBERT` or `FinBERT`) using a library such as TensorFlow or Hugging Face's Transformers.\n   - **Prompt Tuning Adjustments**: Modify input data handling to incorporate prompt engineering. This involves adjusting the text input to integrate market indicators like ROC, RSI, and temporal context directly into the textual prompts.\n\n### Logic Flow\n1. **Initialize Model**:\n   - Use the `params` dictionary to select and configure the model:\n     - If `params['type']` is `CryptoBERT`, initialize with the CryptoBERT architecture.\n     - If `params['type']` is `FinBERT`, initialize with the FinBERT architecture.\n   - Configure the model for prompt tuning if `prompt_tuning` setting is `True`.\n\n2. **Preprocessing for Prompt Tuning**:\n   - Implement a method to handle the modification of tweet inputs by adding market context directly to the input text:\n     - Extract market-specific features, e.g., previous trends and technical indicators, as configured in `config.yaml`.\n     - Construct textual prompts incorporating these features (e.g., \"Date: 2020, January, 01, Previous Label: bullish, ROC: neutral, RSI: bearish\").\n\n3. **Forward Pass**:\n   - Define the `forward(x: Tensor)` method:\n     - Accepts input tensors representing processed tweet data with incorporated prompts.\n     - Passes the input through the language model to obtain output probabilities/embeddings.\n   - The model's output must align with the prediction of Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral sentiments based on the processed market-informed input prompts.\n\n4. **Training and Fine-tuning**:\n   - Integrate methods to freeze/unfreeze layers during fine-tuning based on the model type and optimization strategy:\n     - For example, freeze initial transformer layers to retain base knowledge of language structure and focus fine-tuning on market-specific prompts.\n   - Manage training based on configuration settings such as learning rate and epochs.\n\n5. **Integration with Other Modules**:\n   - The `model` class will be leveraged by `Trainer` module (`trainer.py`) for training execution and by `SignalGenerator` module (`signal_generator.py`) for signal prediction post-training.\n   - Ensure that model outputs are compatible with downstream processing by these modules.\n\n### Key Considerations\n- **Model Selection**: Ensure flexibility in switching between CryptoBERT and FinBERT based on the `model.type` setting.\n- **Prompt Tuning**: Precisely reflect the paper's methodology in embedding market context into textual data by supplementing prompts with relevant financial indicators.\n- **Config-Driven**: Use the configurations in `config.yaml` to drive model initialization and prompt adjustment logic to maintain reproducibility and alignment with the paper's experiment setup.\n\nBy following this structured approach, `model.py` will effectively embody the methodologies described in the research paper, ensuring accurate and reproducible implementation aligned with market-driven labeling and context-aware predictions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1750123810, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_07871e2ad8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 800, "prompt_tokens": 18877, "total_tokens": 19677, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 18816}}}]
