This also involves structuring the datasets so they are ready for subsequent analysis and processing stages, such as market labeling and model training.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Imports and Initial Setup**\n   - Ensure necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `os`, and `yaml` are imported.\n   - Establish access to configuration settings through the `config.yaml` file to handle data paths and preprocessing options.\n\n2. **Configuration Handling**\n   - Read and parse the `config.yaml` for relevant paths and settings:\n     - `bitcoin_events_path`: Filepath for loading Bitcoin event data.\n     - `tweets_data_path`: Filepath for loading Tweets data.\n     - `output_data_path`: Directory where processed data will be saved.\n\n3. **DatasetLoader Class Definition**\n   - **Initialization (`__init__` method)**\n     - Load configuration and store in a class variable for reuse.\n     - Validate paths to ensure files exist before attempting to load data.\n\n   - **Method: `load_event_data()`**\n     - Use `pandas.read_csv` to load historical Bitcoin events data from the file specified in `bitcoin_events_path`.\n     - Confirm data integrity (e.g., non-empty, expected column names present).\n     - Data can include fields such as `Event Date`, `Event Description`, etc.\n     - Handle any necessary date parsing to ensure uniform date formats in subsequent process steps.\n\n   - **Method: `load_tweet_data()`**\n     - Like events, load tweet data using `pandas.read_csv` from `tweets_data_path`.\n     - Implement initial preprocessing directly related to data loading (e.g., checking for and handling missing values).\n     - This data typically consists of fields like `Tweet Date`, `Tweet Content`, `User ID`, etc.\n\n4. **Preprocessing Integration**\n   - **Considerations:**\n     - Only perform essential preprocessing here; detailed text preprocessing should be handled by the `Preprocessor` class.\n     - Ensure basic consistency checks such as uniform date formatting or initial filtering for out-of-scope dates.\n\n5. **Error Handling**\n   - Implement robust error handling for common issues like file not found or data integrity errors (e.g., missing columns).\n   - Utilize meaningful logging to facilitate debugging and tracking of data loading processes.\n\n6. **Data Structuring for Further Steps**\n   - Ensure loaded data is structured into `pandas.DataFrame` and is adequately prepared for integration with pipeline components like `Preprocessor` or `MarketLabeler`.\n   - Set output file paths for saving interim formatted datasets if additional processing stages require it.\n\n### Design Constraints\n- Adhere precisely to the structure: do not assume any additional classes or public methods outside those defined in the initial interface.\n- Avoid changing any structural elements; ensure compatibility with pipeline integration as outlined in the provided design and methodology summaries.\n\n### Reference to Configuration\n- Directly use settings defined in `config.yaml` to determine file paths and other preprocessing options.\n- Maintain the adaptability of the code to changes in config values, ensuring the loader can handle different datasets or preprocessing configurations seamlessly.\n\nBy following this analysis, the `dataset_loader.py` module will perform effectively in gathering and structuring data, ensuring alignment with the experimental setups detailed in the paper and preparing it for subsequent analysis phases.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1750123692, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_07871e2ad8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 726, "prompt_tokens": 18885, "total_tokens": 19611, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}]
