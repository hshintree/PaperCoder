The TBL strategy will involve the calculation and application of upper, lower, and vertical barriers to assign labels to market trends as Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral.\n\n### **Logic Analysis for market_labeler.py**\n\n**1. Configuration Reference:**\n   - Use settings from `config.yaml` for TBL-related configurations.\n   - The `strategy` and `barrier_window` from the config are pivotal for defining how barriers are calculated and applied.\n\n**2. Class Structure:**\n   - **Class Name:** `MarketLabeler`\n   - **Constructor (`__init__`)**: Initialize with settings from the configuration.\n     - Input: `settings` (a dictionary containing configurations).\n     - Initialize parameters related to TBL, such as barrier factors and market volatility estimation method.\n\n**3. Method: `label_data()`**\n   - Purpose: To apply the TBL framework on given market data (e.g., Closing price data) to assign Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral labels.\n\n   - Input Parameter: `data (DataFrame)`\n     - Data should include closing prices and other necessary market indicators that might be needed for accurate volatility estimation and barrier calculations.\n\n   - Steps:\n     1. **Calculate Historical Volatility:** \n        - Use an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) to calculate volatility. This is a rolling standard deviation of logarithmic returns.\n        - Use settings from `config.yaml` to get window length and decay factor.\n     \n     2. **Barrier Calculation:**\n        - **Upper Barrier (`U`)**: Determine using `Closing Price + (Volatility * Upper Barrier Factor)`.\n        - **Lower Barrier (`L`)**: Determine using `Closing Price - (Volatility * Lower Barrier Factor)`.\n        - **Vertical Barrier (`V`)**: A fixed number of days, ranging from 8 to 15 as specified.\n   \n     3. **Label Assignment:**\n        - Iterate over each window in the dataset:\n          - Assign a trend label based on which barrier is touched first within the Vertical Barrier limit:\n            - **Bullish**: If the price touches or surpasses `U` before `L` or `V`.\n            - **Bearish**: If the price drops to or below `L` before `U` or `V`.\n            - **Neutral**: If neither `U` nor `L` is touched by the expiry of `V`.\n        - Once a label is assigned, restart the process with newly updated barriers.\n\n   - Output: A `DataFrame` with market data enriched with labels.\n\n**4. Handling Edge Cases:**\n   - Ensure look-ahead bias is avoided by only using data up to the current point in time for calculations.\n   - Handle overlapping windows by recalculating barriers and adjusting to market conditions dynamically.\n\n**5. Integration with Other Modules:**\n   - This class's output will feed into the model training and evaluation pipeline, so ensure outputs are consistently logged and stored in paths specified by `config.yaml`.\n\nOverall, the `MarketLabeler` class is central for preparing data in a way that aligns market conditions with labeled events, helping in model training and signal generation. This, in turn, allows for the matching of market dynamics onto tweets, a novel aspect in the domain of sentiment analysis within financial markets. This alignment ensures the methodology strictly adheres to the approaches described in the research paper.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1750123771, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_07871e2ad8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 745, "prompt_tokens": 18887, "total_tokens": 19632, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 18816}}}]
