This file will encapsulate all the functionalities needed to assess model performance in alignment with the experimental goals laid out in the paper.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `Evaluation` class is to provide a set of tools to evaluate the model\u2019s predictive performance on tweet classification and subsequent trading signal generation. This aligns with the paper's need for rigorous validation of model outcomes in terms of financial forecasting.\n\n#### Class Structure and Responsibilities:\n\n1. **Class Definition: Evaluation**\n   - This class should be initialized with a trained model and the target dataset to evaluate. This ensures any evaluation is contextually linked to the specific model's forecast and classification capabilities.\n\n2. **Initialization Method: `__init__(self, model: Model, data: DataFrame)`**\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `model`: An instance of the CryptoBERT or FinBERT model, pre-trained and fine-tuned for market-derived sentiment prediction.\n     - `data`: A DataFrame containing the labeled data upon which the model's performance is to be evaluated.\n   - **Objective**: Set up the necessary components for evaluation, such as loading model configurations or data characteristics.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method: `evaluate(self) -> dict`**\n   - **Purpose**: Measure the model's performance using relevant metrics specified in the `config.yaml` (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).\n   - **Steps**:\n     1. **Load Evaluation Metrics**:\n        - Retrieve the list of evaluation metrics defined under the `evaluation` segment of `config.yaml`, ensuring alignment with the experimental metrics stated in the paper.\n        \n     2. **Evaluate Classification Metrics**:\n        - Utilize scikit-learn functions to compute the specified metrics.\n        - Important Metrics:\n          - **Accuracy**: (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total samples.\n          - **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).\n          - **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives).\n          - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n\n     3. **Handle One-Vs-Rest and One-Vs-One Metrics**:\n        - As the evaluation involves multi-class outcomes, handle both OVR (One-Vs-Rest) and OVO (One-Vs-One) scenarios, particularly relevant for distinguishing between Bullish, Bearish, and Neutral.\n        - Utilize scikit-learn's multi-label/binary-metrics where applicable.\n\n4. **Generating Predictions**:\n   - **Calculate Predictions**: Forward the dataset through the model to obtain predictions. This involves passing the input through `Model.forward()` to produce outcome classifications.\n   - **Interpretability**: Provide utility functions, possibly linking with the shap package, to interpret the model's decision-making process if SHAP values are part of the paper\u2019s methodology.\n\n5. **Return Metrics Dictionary**:\n   - Compile the calculated evaluation metrics into a structured dictionary format.\n   - This dictionary should reflect each metric's name against its computed value, ensuring traceability and ease of comparison, such as:\n     ```python\n     results = {\n         \"accuracy\": calculated_accuracy,\n         \"precision\": calculated_precision,\n         \"recall\": calculated_recall,\n         \"f1_score\": calculated_f1\n     }\n     return results\n     ```\n\n6. **Logging and Output**:\n   - Integrate a logging system to output the evaluation results and any anomalies encountered during the process for debugging and record-keeping.\n   - Consider using Python's built-in logging library for structured and level-based logging (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).\n\n#### Considerations:\n- Ensure the evaluation metrics accurately reflect predictive performance not just on classification but also on signal reliability when translated into actionable trading strategies.\n- Keep the evaluation flexible enough to incorporate additional metrics or insights, such as SHAP values for individual tweets if deeper model insight is required.\n- Ensure reproducibility and clarity in results consistent with the experimental objectives delineated in the paper and outlined in the plan.\n\nThis thorough analysis of `evaluation.py` ensures it contributes effectively to assessing model output and fidelity to the market-driven labeling strategy, facilitating alignment with experimental results published in the paper.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1750123889, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_07871e2ad8", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 894, "prompt_tokens": 18883, "total_tokens": 19777, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 18816}}}]
