To effectively reproduce the experiments and methodologies described in the paper "Revisiting Financial Sentiment Analysis: A Language Model Approach," we need a clear and detailed plan that outlines the workflow, datasets, model configuration, training processes, and evaluation metrics. Here's a comprehensive plan that adheres strictly to the paper:

---

### **1. Methodology Overview**

#### **A. Market-Driven Labeling Approach**
- **Objective**: Replace subjective sentiment labels with market-derived labels that reflect real market movements.
- **Triple Barrier Labeling (TBL)**:
  - **Upper Barrier**: Set profit-taking price threshold for Bullish labels.
  - **Lower Barrier**: Set stop-loss price threshold for Bearish labels.
  - **Vertical Barrier**: Temporal constraint defining observation window (8 to 15 days).

#### **B. Language Model Configuration**
- **Models Used**: CryptoBERT and FinBERT as base models.
- **Prompt Tuning**:
  - Incorporate key market indicators such as the Rate of Change (ROC), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and historic market trends into textual prompts.
  - Contextual prompts are created by embedding market and temporal context.

### **2. Data Collection and Preparation**

#### **A. Dataset Requirements**
- **Bitcoin Historical Events**:
  - 227 significant Bitcoin events from 2009 to 2024.
  - Focus on impactful periods between 2015 and 2023.
  - Obtain from Kaggle for reproducibility.
- **Tweets Data**:
  - Sources from PreBit and Kaggle from 2015 to early 2023.
  - Used for model training and evaluation.

#### **B. Preprocessing Steps**
- Text normalization:
  1. Lowercasing.
  2. Removal of URLs, user IDs, and punctuation.
  3. Extraction of emojis and hashtags.
  4. Lemmatization for generalization.
- **Technical Indicators**:
  - Compute RSI and ROC from OHLCV data for prompt tuning.

### **3. Experimental Setup**

#### **A. Feature Engineering**
- **Market-derived Label Assignment**:
  - Use EWMA to estimate volatility.
  - Calculate barriers based on historical volatility.
  - Determine labels based on the TBL method dynamics.

#### **B. Language Model Training**
- **Fine-tuning Methodology**:
  - Use 5-fold cross-validation.
  - Train over 2 epochs as performance plateaus post this point.
  - Use AdamW optimizer with learning rate \(10^{-5}\) and batch size of 12.

### **4. Trading Signal Generation**

#### **A. Signal Generation Methods**
- **Majority and Mean Methods**:
  - Aggregate tweet predictions by majority or average sentiment for generating day-end signals.
  - Use confidence scores linked to position sizes.

#### **B. Incorporation of Fusion Models**
- **Price-based and Sentiment-based Models**:
  - Compare results with LSTM and Autoencoder price-based models.
  - Use a fusion model that incorporates sentiment predictions, and CA model aggregations.

### **5. Backtesting Strategy**

#### **A. Backtesting Environment**
- Use strategies like TBL, In-Out Long/Short.
- Conduct tests across different market regimes (Bullish, Bearish, Neutral).

#### **B. Evaluation Metrics**
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
  - Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown.
  - Profitability measures like cumulative return, daily return.
- Tool for backtesting: Use vectorbt library for evaluation across market conditions.

### **6. Evaluation and Comparison**

#### **A. Classification Performance**
- **Compare Models**:
  - FinBERT, CryptoBERT, CA, and TCA performance on datasets \(E_a\) and \(E_b\).
- **Metrics**:
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score under One-vs-Rest (OVR) and One-vs-One (OVO).

#### **B. Analysis of Results**
- Use SHAP values for interpretability.
- Statistical validation of model improvements using t-tests.

---

### **Additional Notes:**
- Ensure reproducibility via data sources and defined methodologies.
- Address limitations such as overfitting risk with prompt engineering.
- Consider adaptations for evolving market conditions and tweet pattern changes.

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implement and scrutinize the described methodologies, ensuring that every aspect of the paper's experiment is covered and adheres closely to the reported procedures and results.
